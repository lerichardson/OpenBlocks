# OpenBlocks



Currently being created

I switched from C++ back to C because now I can deal with memory

Changes:
- Now rendering rectangle with changable rgba color values
- Added GLSL shader compilation at runtime
- Using indexes to save memory
- Blue background

How to compile:

If you have Windows, download the precompiled binaries from each of these websites:

>https://www.glfw.org

>http://glew.sourceforge.net

If you use Linux or OSX, you will need to compile the source code.


After you have downloaded or compiled the binaries, you will need to link then correctly in your editor or compiler.

Then you can compile the source code.
