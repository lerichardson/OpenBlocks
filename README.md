# OpenBlocks



Currently unfinished & unreleased

I switched from C++ back to C because now I can deal with memory

Changes:
- OpenGl shader functions in seperate shaderInit file

How to compile:

If you have Windows, download the precompiled binaries from each of these websites:

>https://www.glfw.org

>http://glew.sourceforge.net

If you use Linux or OSX, you will need to compile the source code.


After you have downloaded or compiled the binaries, you will need to link then correctly in your editor or compiler.  There are probably tutorials on YouTube if you don't know how to do this.

Then you can compile the source code.
